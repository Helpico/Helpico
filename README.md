As the founder of the **Therapeutic Education Initiative**, I lead a Ukrainian-based non-profit movement focused on a single, urgent mission: building digital-first solutions to help war-affected children heal and learn. My work combines over 20 years of experience across high-level policy design, applied research, teaching and full-stack software development to bridge the gap between psychological trauma and educational recovery.

## ${\color{#EB578C}\text{A Dual Crisis in Ukraine}{\text{}}}$

Ukraine's parents & children are facing a national emergency: This is not just one crisis, but two, deeply connected unprecedented challenges:

1.  **A Mental Health Crisis:** Up to 75% of children show signs of war-related trauma, and nearly one in three screen positive for depression.
2.  **An Educational Crisis:** Over 5 million children have had their education disrupted, with UNICEF reporting an average learning loss of two years in reading.

These crises create a devastating cycle: when a child's nervous system is locked in survival mode, learning becomes impossible. When they fail in school, their trauma deepens. My work is dedicated to breaking this cycle.

## ${\color{#EB578C}\text{Our Approach}{\text{}}}$

Therapeutic Education is a new, interdisciplinary paradigm that sees learning not just as knowledge acquisition, but as a path to emotional and cognitive healing. We answer the question: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but simply cannot?**

Our initiative develops and provides accessible digital tools that empower children to rebuild focus, motivation, and self-confidence.

*   **Social innovation projects:** The initiative's work is delivered through two prototype platforms: **${\color{#21C8D1}\text{Helpica}{\text{}}}$** (a chatbot-course for educators and parents) and **${\color{#21C8D1}\text{Kotya Motya}{\text{}}}$** (a universe of therapeutic games). These are not commercial products, but research-informed tools for our non-profit mission, co-developed with leading Ukrainian and European academic partners.
