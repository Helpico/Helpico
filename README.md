## A National Emergency Demanding a New Vision

Ukraine is facing a devastating, dual crisis its teachers and parents have never encountered on this scale:

> **Mental Health is Shattered:** Up to 75% of our children show signs of war-related trauma (UNICEF).
>
> **Education in Collapse:** Over 5 million children have had their schooling disrupted, resulting in catastrophic learning loss.

These two crises are locked in a destructive cycle: trauma makes learning impossible, and the failure to learn deepens that trauma. This is not an educational gap; it is a national emergency that directly cripples Ukraine's future and is a key driver for families fleeing the country.

## Our Approach: Building a Future Where Every Child Can Learn Again

<p align="left">

</p>

Our work begins with a fundamental question that millions of Ukrainian families now face: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but their trauma won't let them?**

Our answer is a new paradigm we call **Therapeutic Education**. It is built on a simple, powerful truth: for a child in crisis, learning cannot be a battle. It must be a path to healing.

Our approach is twofold:

1. **Empowering the Adults:** We believe that before we can help a child, we must support the adults around them. Our **[Helpica.me](https://helpica.me)** chatbot-course is a first line of defense, providing free, immediate, and practical guidance to teachers and parents. We help them understand that a struggling child is not lazy or incapable to study at school, but is facing an invisible, internal wall. 

2. **Healing the Children:** We provide a new kind of learning tool. Our **[Kotya Motya](https://kotamota.com)** platform offers a universe of unique, therapeutic micro-games tied to their school home assignments of initially the Ukrainian and English languages. They are carefully designed to make the stressful act of learning a gentle, confidence-building experience. They are made to make learning feel safe, achievable, and even joyful again.

<br><br>
   
Through this work, we are restoring a child's belief in themselves. We are turning classrooms and homes from places of potential conflict into spaces of cognitive & emotional recovery. Every lesson transformed is a small victory against the darkness of trauma, a small step toward a resilient and hopeful future for Ukraine.

## The "Dual-Track" Strategy: Immediate Help & A Scalable Future

We believe those who need help today cannot wait for years of research. Our initiative operates on a unique dual track:

1.  **Helping While We Research (Immediate Impact):** We provide a publicly accessible digital platform that is continuously updated with real-time insights and best practices from our work, delivering tangible help from day one.

2.  **Building a Scalable Model (Long-Term Impact):** We partner with leading universities to conduct rigorous scientific validation, creating an evidence-based model of "Therapeutic Education" that can be adopted nationwide and scaled globally.
<br><br>

## Our Proposed Research Alliance

</p>

This initiative is built on a model of international scientific collaboration.

**Core Ukrainian & European Partners:**
*   **Lead Ukrainian Research Partner:** Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University (KDPU)
*   **Academic European Partner:** Czech University of life Sciences Prague (CZU)
*   **Technology & Innovation Partner:** PlayTellect Software Development (NeuroEdTech)

**Scientific & Methodological Advisory Board:**
* **National University of "Kyiv-Mohyla Academy":** Expertise in the fundamental psychology of learning and game-based interventions.
* **Zaporizhzhia National University** & **Oles Honchar Dnipro National University**: Deep expertise in social pedagogy and the practical context of Ukraine's frontline regions.
* **Ukrainian Catholic University**, Faculty of Health Sciences: Critical insight into the intersection of health, ethics, and social work.
* **Ukrainian Institute of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT Institute)**: Clinical consultation on world-class, trauma-informed best practices.
<br><br>

## An Invitation to Lead a Groundbreaking Research Initiative

We are now seeking a **world-class European research institution** to act as the **Lead Applicant and scientific coordinator** for a major grant proposal (e.g., Erasmus+ KA220, Horizon Europe) to rigorously validate this new model.
This is more than a social project; it is a **unique scientific opportunity**:

* To conduct a pioneering study in **translational neuroscience and digital therapeutics**.
* To access a unique **"living laboratory"** and dataset on the cognitive and emotional effects of chronic stress on learning.
* To co-author groundbreaking publications that could **redefine how we approach education in crisis zones globally.**

By combining your institution's deep scientific expertise with our proven, on-the-ground technological platform, we can generate world-class research and create a tangible, scalable solution to a critical global problem.

</p>


## An Invitation to Partner Small-scale

We also seek a **Lead Cultural or Philanthropic Partner** to help scale this vital mission. This is more than a project; it is an investment in a new, Ukrainian-born methodology with the potential to **redefine how the world supports children's education in crisis.** By combining your institution's leadership with our on-the-ground innovation, we can create a lasting, positive impact for millions.
