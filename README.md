**Social Innovator • EdTech/HealthTech Developer • Civic Researcher**

Founder and coordinator of the **Therapeutic Education Initiative**, a Ukrainian-based non-profit movement building digital-first solutions to help children heal and learn through emotionally safe, gamified, and research-informed education. I combine 20+ years of experience across education, public policy, applied research, and full-stack software development.

## About the Therapeutic Education Initiative

Therapeutic Education is a paradigm-shifting initiative focused on transforming education into a vehicle of emotional healing. It seeks to answer one key question:

**What can we do when a child wants to learn, but simply cannot?**

We are developing accessible digital tools that empower children suffering from war-related trauma, anxiety, and attention challenges to gradually rebuild focus, motivation, and self-confidence — without the need for clinical intervention.

### Our Platforms:

* **Helpica** — a chat-based visual learning guide for teachers, parents, and teens.
* **Kotya Motya** — a playful digital universe of therapeutic games for children ages 6–15.

Both platforms are being co-developed in collaboration with leading Ukrainian psychologists, educators, and European academic partners.
