## A Crisis Ukraine Was Never Prepared For
Ukraine is facing a challenge its teachers and parents have never encountered on this scale. It is a profound, dual crisis where:

> **Mental Health is Shattered:** Up to 75% of our children show signs of war-related trauma.
> 
> **Education is Disrupted:** Over 5 million children have had their schooling interrupted, leading to devastating learning loss.

These two crises feed each other in a destructive cycle: when a child's nervous system is locked in survival mode, learning feels impossible. When they fail to learn, their trauma and anxiety deepen.
<br><br>
## Our Mission & Approach: Therapeutic Education
Our mission is to break this cycle by building digital-first solutions that help children heal *through* learning. We are pioneering the **"Therapeutic Education"** paradigm, built on the idea that learning itself can be a gentle and effective form of mental health care.

We answer the question: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but their trauma won't let them?**

Our initiative develops accessible digital tools delivered through two core platforms:
*   **Helpica.me:** A chatbot-course that provides practical, trauma-informed guidance to parents and educators.
*   **Kotya Motya:** and **PlayTellect** A universe of free, therapeutic games designed to make learning feel safe and joyful again.

## Our Unique "Dual-Track" Strategy: Immediate Help & Long-Term Solutions
We believe that those who need help today cannot wait for long-term research to conclude. Therefore, our initiative operates on a dual-track:

1.  **Helping While We Research (Immediate Impact):** We provide a publicly accessible digital platform that is continuously updated with real-time insights, tools, and best practices emerging from our work.
2.  **Building a Scalable Model (Long-Term Impact):** We conduct rigorous scientific validation to create an evidence-based model of "Therapeutic Education" that can be adopted nationwide.

This approach ensures we provide tangible help from day one, while building a sustainable, systemic solution for Ukraine's future.
<br><br>
## Our Vision for Partnership: A Bridge of Mutual Expertise
This initiative is a networked effort anchored by a robust **Scientific Alliance** of leading Ukrainian and European academic institutions.

**Our Scientific Alliance Includes:**
*   **Lead Ukrainian Research Partner:** Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University (KDPU)
*   **Lead European Partner:** Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU)
*   **Scientific & Methodological Advisory Board:**
    *   National University of "Kyiv-Mohyla Academy" (NaUKMA)
    *   Zaporizhzhia National University (ZNU)
    *   Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU)
    *   Ukrainian Institute of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT Institute)

We now invite a **Lead Cultural or Philanthropic Partner** to join this alliance. We see this partnership not as a one-way street, but as a true **mutual exchange**. Our platform offers a direct channel for world-class European knowledge to meet Ukrainian need, while also providing a unique opportunity for partners to engage with and learn from Ukraine's experience in building resilience.
<br><br>
## An Invitation to Partner

We are confident that by combining your institution's cultural leadership with our on-the-ground innovation, we can create a lasting, positive impact for children in Ukraine and beyond. We welcome the opportunity to explore this collaboration with you.
