My work is driven by a single, urgent mission: to build digital-first solutions that help children heal through learning. As a Ukrainian educator, developer, and father, I have dedicated my work to bridging the immense gap between psychological trauma and educational recovery. This is the home of the **Therapeutic Education Initiative**.

## A Crisis Ukraine Was Never Prepared For
Ukraine is facing a challenge its teachers and parents have never encountered on this scale. It is a profound, dual crisis where:

> **Mental Health is Shattered:** Up to 75% of our children show signs of war-related trauma.
> **Education is Disrupted:** Over 5 million children have had their schooling interrupted, leading to devastating learning loss.

These two crises feed each other in a destructive cycle: when a child's nervous system is locked in survival mode, learning feels impossible. When they fail to learn, their trauma and anxiety deepen. My work is dedicated to breaking this cycle.

## Our Approach: Therapeutic Education
We are pioneering the "Therapeutic Education" paradigm. It is built on a simple but powerful idea: that learning itself can be a gentle and effective form of mental health care. We answer the question: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but their trauma won't let them?**

Our initiative develops accessible digital tools that empower children to rebuild focus, motivation, and emotional safety. These tools are delivered through our two core platforms:
*   **Helpica.me:** A chatbot-course that provides practical, trauma-informed guidance to parents and educators.
*   **Kotya Motya:** A universe of free, therapeutic games designed to make learning feel safe and joyful again for all Ukrainian children.

## From a Ukrainian Solution to a Global Model
While born from Ukraine's crisis, the principles of Therapeutic Education are universal. The challenges of trauma, anxiety, and ADHD affecting a child's ability to learn are global.

Our ambition is to develop this Ukrainian-born innovation into an open, evidence-based model that other organizations and institutions can adapt and deploy worldwide. We are not just solving a local problem; we are building a new approach to inclusive education for children facing adversity everywhere.

## A Partnership for Research & Mutual Exchange
This initiative is designed to be a living laboratory. We are actively seeking collaboration with international partners to scientifically validate and scale the Therapeutic Education model.

We see this not as a one-way street, but as a **bridge of expertise**—a space for genuine dialogue and shared impact. Our platform offers a direct channel for European knowledge to meet Ukrainian need, while also providing a unique opportunity for partners to engage with and learn from Ukraine's experience in building resilience.

In a mutual partnership, we can:
*   **Co-design and test** our transformative digital tools in real-world school settings.
*   **Conduct rigorous trials** under a strict scientific framework to measure impact on learning and mental wellbeing.
*   **Publish and share** our joint findings to contribute to a global body of knowledge on trauma-informed ed-tech.

## Our Collaborative Ecosystem
This initiative does not operate in isolation. It is supported by a robust consortium of academic and institutional partners who have expressed a commitment to its success. This ecosystem ensures our work is scientifically grounded, deeply integrated into the local context, and aligned with European standards.

*   **Lead Ukrainian Research Partner:** Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University (KDPU)
