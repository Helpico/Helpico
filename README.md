## A National Emergency Demanding a New Vision
Ukraine is facing a devastating, dual crisis its teachers and parents have never encountered on this scale:

> **Mental Health is Shattered:** Up to 75% of our children show signs of war-related trauma (UNICEF).
>
> **Education in Collapse:** Over 5 million children have had their schooling disrupted, resulting in catastrophic learning loss.

These two crises are locked in a destructive cycle: trauma makes learning impossible, and the failure to learn deepens that trauma. This is not an educational gap; it is a national emergency that directly cripples Ukraine's future and is a key driver for families fleeing the country.

## Our Approach: Building the Future of Education in Crisis

Our work begins by asking a fundamental question that millions of Ukrainian families now face: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but their trauma won't let them?**

Our answer is a new paradigm we call **Therapeutic Education**. It is built on a simple truth: before we can help a child, we must first change the environment around them. Therefore, our primary mission is to **raise awareness among teachers, parents, and policymakers**, helping them understand that a struggling child is not lazy or incapable, but is facing an invisible, internal wall.

To support both the adults and the children, our initiative provides a suite of practical, science-backed digital tools:

**For Adults (Raising Awareness):** Our **[Helpica.me](https://helpica.me)** chatbot-course provides the immediate, trauma-informed guidance that empowers adults to reduce pressure and create emotionally safe learning environments.

**For Children (Providing a New Way to Learn):** Our **[Kotya Motya](https://kotamota.com)** platform offers a universe of unique, therapeutic games. These are not typical educational apps. They are designed to work *with* a child's vulnerable emotional state, rebuilding their confidence and capacity to learn through positive, non-stressful interactions.

<br>

## The "Dual-Track" Strategy: Immediate Help & A Scalable Future

We believe those who need help today cannot wait for years of research. Our initiative operates on a unique dual track:

1.  **Helping While We Research (Immediate Impact):** We provide a publicly accessible digital platform that is continuously updated with real-time insights and best practices from our work, delivering tangible help from day one.
2.  **Building a Scalable Model (Long-Term Impact):** We partner with leading universities to conduct rigorous scientific validation, creating an evidence-based model of "Therapeutic Education" that can be adopted nationwide and scaled globally.

## Our Proposed Research Alliance
This initiative is built on a model of international scientific collaboration.

**Core Ukrainian & European Partners:**
*   **Lead Ukrainian Research Partner:** Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University (KDPU)
*   **Academic European Partner:** Czech University of life Sciences Prague (CZU)
*   **Technology & Innovation Partner:** PlayTellect Software Development

**Scientific & Methodological Advisory Board:**
*   National University of "Kyiv-Mohyla Academy" (NaUKMA)
*   Dnipro National University (DNU)
*   Zaporizhzhia National University (ZNU)
*   Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU)
*   Ukrainian Institute of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT Institute)

</p>

## An Invitation to Lead a Groundbreaking Research Initiative

We are now seeking a **world-class European research institution** to act as the **Lead Applicant and scientific coordinator** for a major grant proposal (e.g., Erasmus+ KA220, Horizon Europe) to rigorously validate this new model.
This is more than a social project; it is a **unique scientific opportunity**:

* To conduct a pioneering study in **translational neuroscience and digital therapeutics**.
* To access a unique **"living laboratory"** and dataset on the cognitive and emotional effects of chronic stress on learning.
* To co-author groundbreaking publications that could **redefine how we approach education in crisis zones globally.**

By combining your institution's deep scientific expertise with our proven, on-the-ground technological platform, we can generate world-class research and create a tangible, scalable solution to a critical global problem.

## An Invitation to Partner under a Small-scale Project 

We also seek a **Lead Cultural or Philanthropic Partner** to help scale this vital mission. This is more than a project; it is an investment in a new, Ukrainian-born methodology with the potential to **redefine how the world supports children's education in crisis.** By combining your institution's leadership with our on-the-ground innovation, we can create a lasting, positive impact for millions.
