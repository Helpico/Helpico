*"My name is Maksym Dudyk. I am the founder of **"Kotya Motya"** â€“ Ukraine's first educational-therapeutic game designed for children facing learning difficulties due to stress and anxiety from the war.*

*Our NGO, the "Foundation for the Development of the Ukrainian Language on the Internet," has developed "Kotya Motya" ([www.kotamota.com](https://www.kotamota.com)): a digital assistant that helps children rediscover their interest in learning through adaptive play and pressure-free support. As an educator, programmer, father of many, and an IDP myself, I created this complete educational product without investment, driven by the urgent need during wartime. The platform, which already has a test version and initial users, combines modern technology with profound social impact and is ready to scale.*

*Our focus is not just to teach, but to help thousands of children restore their faith in themselves. We are ready to expand this solution and seek support to complete its full launch and reach those in need."*
