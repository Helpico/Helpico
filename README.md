## A National Emergency Demanding a New Response
Ukraine is facing a devastating, dual crisis that traditional methods cannot solve:

> **Mental Health Under Siege:** Up to 75% of our children show signs of war-related trauma (UNICEF).
>
> **Education in Collapse:** Over 5 million children have had their schooling disrupted, resulting in catastrophic learning loss.

These two crises are locked in a destructive cycle: trauma makes learning impossible, and the failure to learn deepens that trauma. This is not an educational gap; it is a national emergency that threatens a generation.

## Our Approach: A New Paradigm for Healing and Learning

Our approach is built on a revolutionary idea: **the learning process itself can be the primary tool for recovery.** We don't just treat the symptoms; we transform the cause of the stress. This is **Therapeutic Education**.

To make this a reality, we focus on two interconnected goals:

*   **Raising National Awareness:** We work to change the conversation among teachers, parents, and policymakers, helping them understand that a struggling child needs empathy and tailored support, not more pressure.
*   **Providing Practical Tools:** We develop free, science-backed digital solutions that are immediately accessible to any family with a mobile phone. Our **Helpica.me** chatbot provides guidance for adults, while our **Kotya Motya** platform offers a universe of therapeutic games for children.

## The "Dual-Track" Strategy: Immediate Help & A Scalable Future

We believe those who need help today cannot wait for years of research. Our initiative operates on a unique dual track:

1.  **Helping While We Research (Immediate Impact):** We provide a publicly accessible digital platform that is continuously updated with real-time insights and best practices from our work, delivering tangible help from day one.
2.  **Building a Scalable Model (Long-Term Impact):** We partner with leading universities to conduct rigorous scientific validation, creating an evidence-based model of "Therapeutic Education" that can be adopted nationwide and scaled globally.

## Our Alliance: A Bridge Between Ukrainian Resilience and European Expertise

This initiative is a networked effort anchored by a robust **Scientific Alliance**.

**Core Ukrainian & European Partners:**
*   **Lead Ukrainian Research Partner:** Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University (KDPU)
*   **Lead European Partner:** Czech University of life Sciences Prague (CZU)

**Scientific & Methodological Advisory Board:**
*   National University of "Kyiv-Mohyla Academy" (NaUKMA)

## An Invitation to Partner with a Ukrainian-Born Global Innovation

We now seek a **Lead Cultural or Philanthropic Partner** to help us scale this vital mission. This is more than a project; it is an investment in a new, Ukrainian-born methodology with the potential for global relevance. By combining your institution's leadership with our on-the-ground innovation, we can create a lasting, positive impact for millions of children in Ukraine and beyond.
