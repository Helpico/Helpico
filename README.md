As the founder of the **Helpica Initiative for Therapeutic Education**, I lead a Ukrainian-based non-profit movement focused on a single, urgent mission: building digital-first solutions to help war-affected children heal and learn. My work combines over 20 years of experience across education, public policy, applied research, and full-stack software development to bridge the gap between psychological trauma and educational recovery.

Ukraine's children are facing a national emergency. This is not just one crisis, but two, deeply connected:

1.  **A Mental Health Crisis:** Up to 75% of children show signs of war-related trauma, and nearly one in three screen positive for depression.
2.  **An Educational Crisis:** Over 5 million children have had their education disrupted, with UNICEF reporting an average learning loss of two years in reading.

These crises create a devastating cycle: when a child's nervous system is locked in survival mode, learning becomes impossible. When they fail in school, their trauma deepens. My work is dedicated to breaking this cycle.

## ${\color{#EB578C}\text{Our Approach: The Helpica Initiative}{\text{}}}$

The **Helpica Initiative** is pioneering the **"Therapeutic Education"** paradigm, which sees learning not just as knowledge acquisition, but as a path to emotional and cognitive healing. We answer the question: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but simply cannot?**

Our initiative develops and provides accessible digital tools that empower children to rebuild focus, motivation, and self-confidence.

*   **Our Platforms:** The initiative's work is delivered through two interconnected, research-informed platforms: **Helpica.me** (a chatbot-course for educators and parents) and **Kotya Motya** (a universe of therapeutic games). These are not commercial products, but tools for our non-profit mission, co-developed with leading Ukrainian and European academic partners.
