As a social innovator and EdTech architect, I build digital solutions to address the dual crisis of education and mental health facing war-affected children in Ukraine. My work combines over 20 years of experience across public policy, applied research, and full-stack software development to create a sustainable, dual-track ecosystem for healing and learning.

## ${\color{#EB578C}\text{My Mission: A Dual-Track Approach}{\text{}}}$

To tackle this generational challenge, I have founded two distinct but interconnected initiatives:

1.  **The `Helpica` Initiative (Non-Profit):** A research-driven effort focused on the scientific validation of the **"Therapeutic Education"** model. We partner with universities to conduct research and develop free, accessible digital tools (`Helpica.me`, `Kotya Motya`) for every child, parent, and teacher in Ukraine. This is our **social impact arm**.

2.  **`PlayTellect` (For-Profit Venture):** A HealthTech startup focused on building and scaling the core **AI-powered technology** that makes Therapeutic Education possible. `PlayTellect` is a finalist in the prestigious **EIT Jumpstarter 2025** programme. This is our **technology and sustainability engine**.

This hybrid model allows us to pursue a powerful social mission while building a sustainable, scalable technological foundation.

Ukraine's children face a devastating cycle: war-related trauma blocks their ability to learn, and school failure deepens that trauma. My work is dedicated to breaking this cycle by providing tools that are **emotionally safe and cognitively effective.**

I am actively seeking collaboration with academic institutions, NGOs, and impact investors to advance the mission of both the `Helpica` Initiative and `PlayTellect`. My goal is to transform this Ukrainian-born model into a global public good.

**I bring to our partnership:**
*   A proven, operational technology platform ready for research and scaling.
*   Leadership across both non-profit and for-profit innovation models.
*   A track record in project strategy, grant-writing, and impact delivery.
