My work is driven by a single, urgent mission: to build digital-first solutions that help children heal through learning. As a Ukrainian educator, developer, and father, I have dedicated my work to bridging the immense gap between psychological trauma and educational recovery. This is the home of the **Therapeutic Education Initiative**.


## ${\color{#EB578C}\text{A Crisis Ukraine Was Never Prepared For}{\text{}}}$

Ukraine is facing a challenge its teachers and parents have never encountered on this scale. It is a profound, dual crisis where:

1.  **Mental Health is Shattered:** Up to 75% of our children show signs of war-related trauma.
2.  **Education is Disrupted:** Over 5 million children have had their schooling interrupted, leading to devastating learning loss.

These two crises feed each other in a destructive cycle: when a child's nervous system is locked in survival mode, learning feels impossible. When they fail to learn, their trauma and anxiety deepen. My work is dedicated to breaking this cycle.


## Our Approach: Therapeutic Education

We are pioneering the **"Therapeutic Education"** paradigm. It is built on a simple but powerful idea: that learning itself can be a gentle and effective form of mental health care. We answer the question: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but their trauma won't let them?**

Our initiative develops accessible digital tools that empower children to rebuild focus, motivation, and emotional safety. These tools are delivered through our two core platforms:

*   **Helpica.me:** A chatbot-course that provides practical, trauma-informed guidance to parents and educators.
*   **Kotya Motya:** A universe of free, therapeutic games designed to make learning feel safe and joyful again for all Ukrainian children.

## From a Ukrainian Solution to a Global Model

While born from Ukraine's crisis, the principles of Therapeutic Education are universal. The challenges of trauma, anxiety, and ADHD affecting a child's ability to learn are global.

**Our ambition is to develop this Ukrainian-born innovation into an open, evidence-based model that other organizations and institutions can adapt and deploy worldwide.** We are not just solving a local problem; we are building a new approach to inclusive education for children facing adversity everywhere.


## A Partnership for Research & Impact

**This initiative is designed to be a living laboratory.** We are actively seeking collaboration with international academic institutions to scientifically validate and scale the Therapeutic Education model.

We are ready to build an ecosystem for rigorous, evidence-based research. In partnership, we can:
*   **Co-design and test** our transformative games and digital tools in school settings.
*   **Conduct clinical and pedagogical trials** under a strict scientific framework to measure impact on learning outcomes and mental wellbeing.
*   **Publish and share** our findings to contribute to a global body of knowledge on trauma-informed ed-tech.

This work is supported by our partnership with the **Department of Psychology and Pedagogy at the National University of "Kyiv-Mohyla Academy" (NaUKMA), led by Prof. Andriy Hirnyk**, ensuring a strong academic foundation for all our research activities.


## My Core Competencies

*   **Full-Stack Engineering:** Python, Node.js, TypeScript/JavaScript, React/Next.js, PostgreSQL.
*   **AI & LLM Orchestration:** LangChain for intelligent agents, RAG-based knowledge retrieval, and vector search (pgvector). Experience with local LLMs (Ollama, Llama 3) for offline-capable, secure AI processing.
*   **Trauma-Informed UX:** Designing gamified, emotionally safe digital environments for neurodivergent learners.
*   **Scalable Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes (Prometheus certified), CI/CD pipelines, and Linux/Nginx server administration.
