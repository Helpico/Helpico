## A Crisis Ukraine Was Never Prepared For
Ukraine is facing a challenge its teachers and parents have never encountered on this scale. It is a profound, dual crisis where:

> **Mental Health is Shattered:** Up to 75% of our children show signs of war-related trauma.
> **Education is Disrupted:** Over 5 million children have had their schooling interrupted, leading to devastating learning loss.

These two crises feed each other in a destructive cycle: when a child's nervous system is locked in survival mode, learning feels impossible. When they fail to learn, their trauma and anxiety deepen. My work is dedicated to breaking this cycle.

## Our Approach: Therapeutic Education
We are pioneering the "Therapeutic Education" paradigm. It is built on a simple but powerful idea: that learning itself can be a gentle and effective form of mental health care. We answer the question: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but their trauma won't let them?** We are driven by a single, urgent mission: to build digital-first solutions that help children heal through learning.

Our initiative develops accessible digital tools that empower children to rebuild focus, motivation, and emotional safety. These tools are delivered through our two core platforms:
*   **Helpica.me:** A chatbot-course that provides practical, trauma-informed guidance to parents and educators.
*   **Kotya Motya:** A universe of free, therapeutic games designed to make learning feel safe and joyful again for all Ukrainian children.

## From a Ukrainian Solution to a Global Model
While born from Ukraine's crisis, the principles of Therapeutic Education are universal. The challenges of trauma, anxiety, and ADHD affecting a child's ability to learn are global.

Our ambition is to develop this Ukrainian-born innovation into an open, evidence-based model that other organizations and institutions can adapt and deploy worldwide. We are not just solving a local problem; we are building a new approach to inclusive education for children facing adversity everywhere.

## Our Vision for Partnership: A Bridge of Mutual Expertise

This initiative is a networked effort, not a solo project. It is anchored by a robust **Scientific Alliance** of leading Ukrainian and European academic institutions committed to moving forward with the scientific validation and testing of the Therapeutic Education model.

**Our Scientific Alliance Includes:**
*   **Lead Ukrainian Research Partner:** Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University (KDPU)
*   **Lead European Partner:** Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CZU)
*   **Scientific & Methodological Advisory Board:**
    *   National University of "Kyiv-Mohyla Academy" (NaUKMA)
    *   Zaporizhzhia National University (ZNU)
    *   Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU)
    *   Ukrainian Institute of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT Institute)

We now invite a **Lead Cultural or Philanthropic Partner** to join this alliance. We see this partnership not as a one-way street, but as a true **mutual exchange**. Our platform offers a direct channel for world-class European knowledge to meet Ukrainian need, while also providing a unique opportunity for partners to engage with and learn from Ukraine's experience in building resilience.

In this partnership, we can:
*   **Co-design and test** our transformative digital tools in real-world school settings.
*   **Conduct rigorous trials** to measure impact on learning and mental wellbeing.
*   **Publish and share** our joint findings to contribute to a global body of knowledge.
