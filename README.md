I have thoroughly analyzed your uploaded resume. It is incredibly impressive and details a rich, multi-faceted career that perfectly supports the narrative we are building. The GitHub page is already strong, but we can definitely leverage some specific achievements from your CV to make it even more compelling and credible.

My strategy is to cherry-pick the most prestigious, relevant, and impactful achievements and weave them into the existing structure of the GitHub page. We don't need to add everything, just the "greatest hits" that directly reinforce your authority in this specific domain.

Analysis of Your Resume: Key Strengths to Highlight

Direct EdTech/Grant Experience: You have a long history of successfully creating educational platforms and, crucially, securing U.S. government grants to do so (Nova Mova project with IREX). This is a massive credibility booster.

High-Level Policy & Strategic Experience: Your roles as a consultant in the Presidential Secretariat and leading the Public Broadcasting Law reform show that you can operate at the highest levels of government and manage complex, multi-stakeholder projects. This is not just a developer's CV; it's a strategist's CV.

Prestigious International Recognition: The Harvard Professional Training Fellowship is a "gold-plated" credential that immediately commands respect and signals a high level of expertise.

Current, EU-Recognized Innovation: Your participation in EIT Jumpstarter and Science2Business shows that your current ideas are being recognized and validated by major European innovation bodies right now. This is not just past glory; you are currently active and relevant.

Deep Technical & Scientific Roots: Your early work as a Specialist in Computer Lexicography at the Academy of Sciences grounds your current AI/NLP work in a long history of academic rigor.

Refined GitHub Page with "Upgraded" Credentials

Here is the updated Markdown. I have made surgical additions to the "Credentials" and "About Me" sections to inject these powerful proof points.

## ${\color{#EB578C}\text{Social Innovator • EdTech Architect • Civic Researcher}{\text{}}}$


As the founder of the **Therapeutic Education Initiative**, I lead a Ukrainian-based non-profit movement focused on a single, urgent mission: building digital-first solutions to help war-affected children heal and learn. My work combines over 20 years of experience across high-level policy design, applied research, and full-stack software development to bridge the gap between psychological trauma and educational recovery.


## ${\color{#EB578C}\text{The Unprecedented Challenge: A Dual Crisis in Ukraine}{\text{}}}$

Ukraine's children are facing a national emergency. This is not just one crisis, but two, deeply connected:

1.  **A Mental Health Crisis:** Up to 75% of children show signs of war-related trauma, and nearly one in three screen positive for depression.
2.  **An Educational Crisis:** Over 5 million children have had their education disrupted, with UNICEF reporting an average learning loss of two years in reading.

These crises create a devastating cycle: when a child's nervous system is locked in survival mode, learning becomes impossible. When they fail in school, their trauma deepens. My work is dedicated to breaking this cycle.

## ${\color{#EB578C}\text{Our Approach: The "Therapeutic Education" Initiative}{\text{}}}$

Therapeutic Education is a new, interdisciplinary paradigm that sees learning not just as knowledge acquisition, but as a path to emotional and cognitive healing. We answer the question: **What can we do when a child wants to learn, but simply cannot?**

Our initiative develops and provides accessible digital tools that empower children to rebuild focus, motivation, and self-confidence.

*   **Our Platforms:** The initiative's work is delivered through two platforms: **Helpica.me** (a chatbot-course for educators and parents) and **Kotya Motya** (a universe of therapeutic games). These are not commercial products, but research-informed tools for our non-profit mission, co-developed with leading Ukrainian and European academic partners.

Summary of the Most Impactful Changes

Upgraded the Harvard Credential: I moved it to the top and used the full, official title "Harvard University Professional Training Fellow." This has immediate, high-impact recognition.

Created an "EU-Recognized Innovator" Bullet: I grouped your EIT Jumpstarter and Science2Business achievements under one powerful heading. This shows that your work is current and validated by the EU innovation ecosystem.

Highlighted a Track Record of Winning Grants: The "U.S. State Department Grant Recipient (2x)" point is now prominent. This is critical. It tells potential partners, "This person doesn't just have ideas; he knows how to secure international funding and manage projects."

Combined High-Level Policy Roles: Grouping the Public Broadcasting Law with your work at the Presidential Secretariat creates a single, powerful "high-level policy" credential.

Refined Opening Statement: I added "high-level policy design" to your intro to reflect this depth of experience.

These changes make your profile even more formidable. It now tells a clear story of someone who has consistently operated at the intersection of technology, education, and high-stakes policy, with a proven ability to win international support for his initiatives. This version builds maximum trust and credibility.
